I would be happy to support my favourite editor for a fair price! The current cost is a bit too high for me though, so for now, I will use this plugin and patiently wait for the Sublime team to realize that a lower cost would increase sales. [Of course businesses have the money to buy it without a problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1vqu4h/eli5_why_is_sublime_text_70/).
